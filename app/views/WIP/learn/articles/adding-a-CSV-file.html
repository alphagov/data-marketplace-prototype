    <p>The Data Marketplace allows government organisations to publish descriptions of data (known as metadata) so they can be found by anyone in government. Once found, a data share request can be made to facilitate access to the data under the agreed terms. The Data Marketplace does not host the data itself or provide access to the data. Your data description will be published to the Data Marketplace and will be available to be found by other government organisations who are looking for data.</p>
    <p>All data descriptions should be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR). With data being published to the Data Marketplace, it should be easy to find, labelled with the correct access rights, described to support interoperability with other data, and well described to support reuse. The descriptions of data should have their own identifiers and remain in the marketplace even if the data is no longer available.</p>
    <p>The Data Marketplace supports descriptions of datasets and data services. A dataset is a collection of data, published or curated by a single agent and available for access or download in one or more representations. A data service is a collection of operations that provides access to one or more datasets or data processing functions.</p>
    <p>Data descriptions can be added in a number of ways including:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>Manually through a web form</li>
      <li>Upload using our CSV template</li>
      <li>Catalogue connection to synchronise the descriptions in your organisation data catalogue with the Data Marketplace (using a data harvester)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To publish data descriptions you must have a Data Marketplace account with publish permission for your organisation. See X for how to get an account with publish permissions. The publisher dashboard will give you an overview of the data your organisation has published in the Data Marketplace and how it is being used.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">CSV Upload of Metadata records</h2>
    <p>You can add data descriptions using a CSV file. This can be used to provide multiple data descriptions in a single process. The descriptions must be added to the provided CSV file template, which has been structured to ensure descriptions conform to <a href="https://alasdairgray.github.io/data-catalogue-schemas/">the cross-government data sharing metadata model</a>.</p>
    
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Step 1: Gather information about your data description</h3>
    <p>Use the questions as a guide to ensure enough information can be provided at each stage of adding a data description.</p>
    <p>You need to answer the questions to make sure your published data description will be helpful to users trying to find data. You should avoid using domain specific jargon, acronyms and abbreviations. Write your description in plain English.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Step 2: Entering your descriptions into the CSV file</h3>
    <p>Download the CSV template file and provide your answers to the questions under the relevant columns.</p>
    <p>The first tab in the spreadsheet provides some guidance on using the template. The Dataset tab should be completed with the values for your dataset descriptions (the data made available as a file download). The DataService tab should be completed with the values for your data service descriptions (the data that is made available as a web API).</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Step 3: Uploading the CSV file to the Data Marketplace</h3>
    <p>Sign in to the Data Marketplace and navigate to the Publish data descriptions dashboard. Then click on the ‘Add new data description’ button. On the next page you will need to select Upload a CSV file of data asset descriptions.</p>

    <img style="border:1px solid grey;" src="/public/images/learn/how-do-you-want-to-add-your-data-description.png" alt="Add your data description screenshot"/>
    <br>
    <br>

    <p>You will now be taken through to a page where you can download the CSV template file for providing your data descriptions. When you are ready, click on the Upload CSV file button.</p>

    <img style="border:1px solid grey;" src="/public/images/learn/upload-CSV-page.png" alt="Upload a CSV file screenshot"/>
    <br>
    <br>

    <p>On the next page, you can upload the CSV file containing your data descriptions. You will need to select the CSV file from the device you want to upload.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Step 4: Review you entered description</h3>
    <p>Once you have uploaded your file, you will see an Upload summary page, where you can check the status of your uploaded file.</p>
    <p>For a file with an ERROR, note the reason and amend the CSV file before selecting the Re-upload data button. You will be taken through the upload process again.</p>

    <img style="border:1px solid grey;" src="/public/images/learn/failed-upload-CSV-summary.png" alt="Upload summary with errors screenshot"/>
    <br>
    <br>

    <p>If no errors are found, you will see a summary page of the data descriptions that have been extracted from the CSV file. You should review each entry to ensure the values have been captured correctly. If you find something that doesn’t look right, you should fix this in your CSV file and select the Re-upload CSV file option.</p>
    <p>Once you are happy that the data descriptions are correct, you can select the Publish data asset description button which will add the data descriptions to the Data Marketplace. Finally, you will be shown a success page and given the option to return to the publisher dashboard.</p>
