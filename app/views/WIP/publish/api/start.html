        Connect to the Data Marketplace API
      </h1>

      <p>
        This API allows you to automatically publish and update listings in
        the Data Marketplace’s catalogue, using information from your organisation’s data catalogue or data store.
      </p>
      <p>
        You’ll need someone with technical expertise and knowledge of APIs
        to do this integration. Typically this will be an API developer.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’re a developer, you can <a href="/WIP/support/ipa">get started with the API</a>.
      </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        Ask your developer to join the Data Marketplace
      </h2>

      <p>
        Your API developer must work in your organisation and have a government email address with your organisation’s
        domain (for example, hmrc.gov.uk).
      </p>

      <p>
        They need to <a href="/WIP/support/get-started">create a Data Marketplace account</a> and then request the Metadata Publisher role from
        their user profile.
      </p>

      <p>
        They will then be able to connect to the API.
