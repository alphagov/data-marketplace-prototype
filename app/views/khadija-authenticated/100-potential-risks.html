  <p>
  As a data controller or owner in government, it is essential to carefully consider any request to share personal data from another government department. There are several risks involved in starting to negotiate a data agreement without first consulting your subject matter experts, including:</p>

  <p>
  Legal compliance risks: If you share personal data without ensuring compliance with data protection laws and regulations, you may be at risk of violating privacy laws, which can lead to legal penalties.</p>

  <p>
  Security risks: Sharing personal data without proper security measures in place can result in data breaches, which can compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of personal data.</p>

  <p>
  Reputation risks: If personal data is mishandled or misused, it can damage the reputation of the agency responsible for the data, and erode public trust in the government.</p>

  <p>Operational risks: Sharing personal data without a clear understanding of its purpose and intended use can lead to operational inefficiencies, delays, and mistakes.</p>

  <p>Consulting with subject matter experts, such as data protection, legal, and security professionals, can help mitigate these risks by ensuring that any data sharing agreements are compliant with relevant laws and regulations, adhere to best practices for data protection and security, and align with the agency's strategic goals and objectives.</p>
