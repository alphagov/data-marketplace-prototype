  <p>
 In the UK, some types of data do not require a data sharing agreement between government departments. These are:

Publicly available data: Data that is already available to the public does not require a data sharing agreement. Examples of publicly available data include information available on government websites, publications, and open data portals.
Anonymized data: Data that has been anonymized so that it cannot be linked back to individuals does not require a data sharing agreement. Anonymization is the process of removing identifying information from data.
Aggregated data: Data that has been aggregated or summarized to protect the privacy of individuals does not require a data sharing agreement. Aggregation involves combining individual data points into a larger dataset that does not identify individuals.
Data shared under statutory or legal obligation: Some data may be shared between government departments under statutory or legal obligations, which do not require a data sharing agreement.
It is important to note that while some types of data may not require a data sharing agreement, they still need to be handled in accordance with data protection regulations and guidelines to ensure privacy and security.
