DS00031<divider>Department for Work and Pensions<divider>The proof of concept, covered by DR160927.02 (documented in the 'National Pupil Database third-party requests' found on GOV.uk), demonstrated that data from the Department for Education (Dept.), Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and HM Revenue and Customs could be successfully matched to construct a dataset which enabled analysis of pupils from lower income families, not eligible for free school meals.   The resulting analysis highlighted the value this cross Government work could add to research and policy making in the education sector.   A Memorandum of Understanding has been created to establish an ongoing, regular data sharing process for this purpose which will enable Dept. to help inform evidence-based policy with regard to pupils from lower income households, beyond those captured by the current free school meal based measures of disadvantage.    Instant identifiers are vital to the matching process, without this data it would be impossible to accurately identify matched records across datasets.

DS00050<divider>University of East Anglia (UEA)<divider>For children from troubled backgrounds growing up in foster care, care plans need to successfully promote their well-being through to adulthood. This project will determine whether  long-term foster care as a permanence option is being systematically and appropriately implemented in England as required by the Long-term Foster Care Regulations and Guidance (Department for Education 2015). This will be achieved by identifying which children are in long-term foster care placements, the nature of their pathways in different local authorities, and comparisons with other permanence options i.e. reunification, adoption, and Special Guardianship.  It is essential that the implementation of these 2015 Regulations and Guidance that were intended to improve outcomes in long-term foster care, is investigated, so that policy and practice lessons can be learned.

These matched data allows GCSE subject outcomes to be accurately predicted, based on the relationship between these variables in previous years. The predicted subject outcomes, in turn, determine the position of grade boundaries in current GCSE examinations – a critical procedure.  The public benefit of this work will be that GCSE results will be demonstrably maintained and command public confidence, and the GCSE awarding organisations are compliant with the statutory Ofqual requirements.  <divider>National Pupil Database (NPD)<divider>1 - contains instant identifiers<divider>D - contains GDPR Special Category data E - contains lowest sensitivity data<divider>Annually<divider>Secure file transfer directly to the organisation<divider>01/04/2023<divider>Service Level Agreement reviewed annually.

DS00164<divider>Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) contracted to Department for Education (Dept.)<divider>IFS and the Social Mobility Commission wishes to use the Longitudinal Educational Outcomes (LEO) dataset, looking at the cohort that took their GCSEs in 2002 and for which parental background information can be observed at this time and labour market earnings data that can be observed in the years 2014-2016.   With this data they will estimate intergenerational income mobility across areas in England for the first time. The analysis will also give the first national estimates of intergenerational income mobility for a cohort born in the 1980s. This will seek to replicate, insofar as possible, the work done on mobility within the United States.  The public benefit of this work will be to highlight the estimate of the true persistence in incomes across generations and is claimed to be the first national intergenerational income mobility statistics in 15 years. Moreover, it will show this at a granular regional level, which is also claimed to be the first analysis of its kind. <divider>Longitudinal Educational Outcomes (LEO) National Pupil Database (NPD) Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) Individualised Learner Record (ILR)<divider>3 - contains meaningless identifiers<divider>C - contains sensitive data not captured as a Special Category within GDPR as they are specific to education but, which Dept. believe are equally sensitive, D - contains GDPR Special Category data E - contains lowest sensitivity data<divider>N/A (re-use)<divider>N/A (re-use)<divider>30/06/2022<divider>Licence extension approved - awaiting paperwork 
DS00167<divider>London Economics Ltd on behalf of Centre for Vocational Education Research (CVER)<divider>With the introduction of the Apprenticeship Levy, firms with a payroll  of £3,000,000 or more have to contribute ½% of the excess amount to their own apprenticeship digital service account. The Levy’s aim is to increase the level of training offered whilst ensuring a more appropriate balance of contribution between the Exchequer and employers.  CVER wishes to use the Individualised Learner Record,  Employer Data Service, Inter-Departmental Business Register, Apprenticeship Service and the Employer Skills Survey(2010 and 2018) data to undertake an evaluation of the Levy.    This project will establish the historical background for firms affected and not affected by the Levy.  This will then look  at the impact of the Levy on Apprentices, training volumes and quality. The information  gained will enable employers, apprentices and government to make more informed decisions and establish an evidence base for future evaluation of the impact of the Levy. <divider>Individualised Learner Record (ILR) Employer Data Registration Service (EDRS)<divider>3 - contains meaningless identifiers<divider>D - contains GDPR Special Category data E - contains lowest sensitivity data<divider>One-off<divider>Secure file transfer directly to the organisation<divider>31/03/2023<divider>Licence has not expired

The likelihood of moving or not will be related to the characteristics of the individuals and of their qualifications, to determine whether certain characteristics are more likely to be associated with mobility. Finally, the project will examine the relationship between local labour markets, vocational qualifications and mobility, to determine whether the skills acquired in Further Education match the local labour market needs, and whether those who do move areas make rational decisions in terms of whether there is a shortage of their particular skills in the areas to which they move.  The public benefit of this work will be to policy-makers in terms of understanding the extent to which local skill needs are provided by Further Education, as well as to young people making decisions about which qualifications to take and where to subsequently work.   <divider>Longitudinal Educational Outcomes (LEO) National Pupil Database (NPD) Individualised Learner Record (ILR)<divider>2 - contains meaningful identifiers<divider>C - contains sensitive data not captured as a Special Category within GDPR as they are specific to education but, which Dept. believe are equally sensitive, D - contains GDPR Special Category data E - contains lowest sensitivity data<divider>N/A (re-use)<divider>N/A (re-use)<divider>31/03/2023<divider>Licence has not expired 
DS00251<divider>University of Sheffield On behalf of Centre for Vocational Education Research (CVER)<divider>The University of Sheffield wishes to use matched National Pupil Database-Individualised Learner Record-Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs data from the 2001/2 to 2005/6 GCSE cohorts.   With this data they will investigate gender differences in both the attainment of, and the choice to undertake, STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) subjects in post-16 education. The research will investigate the role of school, family background, and individual ability in explaining differences in both STEM subject participation and attainment. Particular focus will be given to vocational qualifications.   The public benefit of this work will be to identify the existence and extent of gender differences in participation and attainment of STEM subjects in further education, as well as the benefits from doing so. By investigating the determinants of these differences, the research will provide new evidence on how early in life they manifest and suggest potential interventions to correct them and at what stage they could be most effective. <divider>Longitudinal Educational Outcomes (LEO) National Pupil Database (NPD) Individualised Learner Record (ILR)<divider>2 - contains meaningful identifiers<divider>C - contains sensitive data not captured as a Special Category within GDPR as they are specific to education but, which Dept. believe are equally sensitive, D - contains GDPR Special Category data E - contains lowest sensitivity data<divider>N/A (re-use)<divider>N/A (re-use)<divider>31/03/2023<divider>Licence has not expired 
DS00252<divider>University of Sheffield On behalf of Centre for Vocational Education Research (CVER)<divider>The University of Sheffield wishes to use matched National Pupil Database-Individualised Learner Record data from the 2006/7 to 2009/10 GCSE cohorts.   With this data they will investigate the impact of (i) the introduction and (ii) subsequent withdrawal of the Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA), which was a means-tested benefit paid directly to full-time students in England aged 16-18 from 2006/07 to 2010/11 inclusive. They will compare the impact of the EMA on students’ participation and attainment by comparing these outcomes with groups of similar students who were not impacted by the EMA because they were in cohorts which pre- or post-dated the EMA.   Developing a better understanding of individuals’ education participation decisions and achievements after the end of compulsory schooling and how these may be impacted by policy interventions is clearly of major public benefit.<divider>National Pupil Database (NPD) Individualised Learner Record (ILR)<divider>2 - contains meaningful identifiers<divider>C - contains sensitive data not captured as a Special Category within GDPR as they are specific to education but, which Dept. believe are equally sensitive, D - contains GDPR Special Category data E - contains lowest sensitivity data<divider>N/A (re-use)<divider>N/A (re-use)<divider>31/03/2023<divider>Licence has not expired 
DS00255<divider>London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE)<divider>LSE wishes to use National Pupil Database data covering applicants to secondary education in the Merton, Sutton and Wandsworth Councils; along with some pupil and school level data that covers the whole of England for comparability studies.   These data will be matched to information about parental preferences sourced from the three Councils, as well as the priority that students received when ranked by schools (or the Councils) to prioritise admission. This information will be used to study how families choose schools and if they take full advantage of the choices they are given. LSE will investigate whether parents apply to as many schools as possible or instead they do not exhaust all choices on the list possibly – specifically because they understate or overstate their likelihood of admission to certain schools.   At a time of increasing demand for school places, the ability to better understand how parents make decisions regarding their application preferences is particularly salient as it will enable local and national policy makers to better tailor the information provided to families. This in turn will help parents and children to better understand their options and guide them towards applications that not only meet their aspirations but also ensure that every child can attend their most suitable school - and thus fulfil their potential. <divider>National Pupil Database (NPD) <divider>3 - contains meaningless identifiers<divider>C - contains sensitive data not captured as a Special Category within GDPR as they are specific to education but, which Dept. believe are equally sensitive, D - contains GDPR Special Category data E - contains lowest sensitivity data<divider>One-off<divider>ONS Secure Research Service<divider>31/08/2022<divider>Confirming licence extension 
DS00257<divider>London School of Economics (LSE) & Political Science  and Centre for Vocational Education Research (CVER)<divider>CVER would like to re-use National Pupil Database (NPD) consisting of Pupil Level Census, Key Stage 2, Key Stage 4 and Key Stage 5, Individual Learner Record (ILR) data and Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) data they already hold for a project studying the outcomes of under-matched learners.    Specifically, they would investigate whether “university bound” young people with comparable qualifications at age 16-18, who go on to choose a different post-18 path (i.e. entering technical education), experience different labour market outcomes (earnings and employment) compared to those who follow a traditional Higher Education path.  To do this, they will use the linked NPD-ILR-HESA data to trace their educational choices.   The research is of public benefit because it will shed light on what works to improve further education.  <divider>National Pupil Database (NPD) Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) Individualised Learner Record (ILR)<divider>3 - contains meaningless identifiers<divider>C - contains sensitive data not captured as a Special Category within GDPR as they are specific to education but, which Dept. believe are equally sensitive, D - contains GDPR Special Category data E - contains lowest sensitivity data<divider>N/A (re-use)<divider>N/A (re-use)<divider>31/03/2023<divider>Licence has not expired

NIESR will also be re-using Longitudinal Education Outcomes data that they already hold.    With these data they will look into longitudinal trajectories in the context of A) family background characteristics like Free School Meals (FSM), Index of Multiple Deprivation or similar, B) prior attainment and C) the KS4-KS5 transition. Most importantly, they would D) focus on “routes” through post-16 vocational education in order to understand more clearly the role of providers (including the context of local availability/variation) and KS5 subject choices on long-term outcomes.  This work is part of the CVER work programme.  The public benefit of this work will be to produce transparent, objective and evidence-based advice for decision making in order to improve social mobility and address educational disadvantage in the United Kingdom. <divider>National Pupil Database (NPD) Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) Individualised Learner Record (ILR)<divider>2 - contains meaningful identifiers<divider>C - contains sensitive data not captured as a Special Category within GDPR as they are specific to education but, which Dept. believe are equally sensitive, D - contains GDPR Special Category data E - contains lowest sensitivity data<divider>One-off<divider>ONS Secure Research Service<divider>31/01/2023<divider>Licence has not expired 
DS00266 <divider>University of Oxford<divider>The University of Oxford wishes to use National Pupil Database data from 2016/17 and 2017/18.  With this data they will examine the choices that families make when filling out their child’s secondary school application form to explore how the ethnic profile of local schools link to the choices parents make. They will use advanced quantitative methods to explore how these choices vary between different ethnic groups and how such choices relate to patterns of ethnic school segregation.  The public benefit of this work will be to deepen our understanding on the drivers of ethnic school segregation in England, in order to design policy responses that help schools reflect the ethnic diversity of their local area. This responds to requests made by Dame Casey in her 2016 government review on inclusion and integration in the UK in which she called for “better data and research… across a range of issues relating to integration” (2016, p. 7).  <divider>National Pupil Database (NPD)<divider>3 - contains meaningless identifiers<divider>C - contains sensitive data not captured as a Special Category within GDPR as they are specific to education but, which Dept. believe are equally sensitive, D - contains GDPR Special Category data E - contains lowest sensitivity data<divider>One-off<divider>ONS Secure Research Service<divider>30/09/2022<divider>Confirming data destruction 
DS00267<divider>University of Birmingham<divider>The University of Birmingham School of Education wishes to examine National Pupil Database data from the last 15 years to better understand the characteristics and outcomes of pupils who are mobile between schools. They require data on pupils’ number of school moves, characteristics (e.g. Free School Meals eligibility, ethnicity, and special educational needs), and attainment from reception to year 11.   The University will examine the relationship between school mobility and student characteristics including whether pupils with certain characteristics tend to move schools more frequently and whether this has adverse effects on school attainment or the support pupils receive (e.g. special educational needs or language support).    The public benefit of this work will be to inform policy and practice by identifying groups of pupils most at risk of having disjointed educational careers, understanding the links between pupil mobility patterns and attainment throughout the school lives of mobile students, and suggesting possible support measures. <divider>National Pupil Database (NPD)<divider>3 - contains meaningless identifiers<divider>C - contains sensitive data not captured as a Special Category within GDPR as they are specific to education but, which Dept. believe are equally sensitive, D - contains GDPR Special Category data E - contains lowest sensitivity data<divider>One-off<divider>ONS Secure Research Service<divider>31/07/2022<divider>Secure environment deactivated 
DS00273<divider>London School of Economics & Political Science (LSE), Centre for Vocational Education Research (CVER).<divider>CVER at the LSE wishes to use the National Pupil Database (NPD), Further Education (FE) data and Higher Education (HE) linked datasets for years 2017 and 2018 linked to datasets already held.   With this data they will analyse the impact of marginally failing to get a C (now grade 4) grade in GCSE English and Maths on future educational outcomes (measured 3 to 5 years after having originally taken the GCSE exams at the age of 16).    The public benefit of this work will be providing information for students, parents, teachers and schools on how failure to achieve a C grade in the core subjects of GCSE English and Maths affects their future chances to progress within the education system. The findings will also provide evidence for public policy decision making.    <divider>National Pupil Database (NPD) Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) Individualised Learner Record (ILR)<divider>2 - contains meaningful identifiers<divider>C - contains sensitive data not captured as a Special Category within GDPR as they are specific to education but, which Dept. believe are equally sensitive, D - contains GDPR Special Category data E - contains lowest sensitivity data<divider>N/A (re-use)<divider>N/A (re-use)<divider>31/03/2023<divider>Licence has not expired 
DS00274<divider>Education Policy Institute (EPI)<divider>EPI wishes to use parental primary and secondary school preferences data 2014 to 2018 matched to National Pupil Databased (NPD) data to undertake a long-term programme of work on school choice.  With this data EPI will perform a range of analyses on how school choice currently operates in order to identify issues where policy could be improved to help deliver a high quality, equitable education system.   These will be freely available in a series of published reports, exploring research questions such as: how do parents choose schools and respond to changes in school structure or quality; how does social selection arise between schools; and what is the impact of school choice on educational outcomes?   The public benefit of this work will be insights on how school choice and admissions can improve educational outcomes for the most disadvantaged and vulnerable young people in our society. <divider>National Pupil Database (NPD) Primary School Preference Data Secondary School Preference Data<divider>3 - contains meaningless identifiers<divider>C - contains sensitive data not captured as a Special Category within GDPR as they are specific to education but, which Dept. believe are equally sensitive, D - contains GDPR Special Category data E - contains lowest sensitivity data<divider>One-off<divider>ONS Secure Research Service<divider>31/08/2022<divider>Confirming licence extension

DS00230<divider>London School of Economics (LSE) & Political Science  Centre for Vocational Education Research (CVER) <divider>CVER based at LSE wishes to use National Pupil Database and Higher Education Statistics Agency data for the years from 2006/2007 to 2015/2016 linked to Individualised Learner Record data for the period 2007/08 to 2014/15.   With this data they will investigate three different research questions. The first studies the effect of the increase in the education participation age on youth crime. The second project looks at the medium-term effects of a large Further Education (FE) capital funding programme on FE college performance and student outcomes.  The third project assesses the effect of the introduction of study programmes into English FE by looking at how exactly the composition of learning changed after the reform, and at achievement and progression to higher levels of learning for affected students.   This work will provide important, policy-relevant insights into the effects of various recent reforms affecting mainly disadvantaged students typically attending further education in England. The research proposed will promote the wellbeing of students in England by providing a rigorous evaluation of the influence of the use of capital grants to fund improvements in the physical conditions of FE colleges, the effect of increasing the education participation age on youth crime, and the effect of introducing study programmes into further education on student achievement. <divider>National Pupil Database (NPD) Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) Individualised Learner Record (ILR)<divider>3 - contains meaningless identifiers<divider>C - contains sensitive data not captured as a Special Category within GDPR as they are specific to education but, which Dept. believe are equally sensitive, D - contains GDPR Special Category data E - contains lowest sensitivity data<divider>N/A (re-use)<divider>N/A (re-use)<divider>31/03/2023<divider>Licence has not expired

The data will be linked with other administrative data held by government to analyse and evaluate how education and skills outcomes affect employment outcomes for benefits claimants and those on specific programmes such as the European Social Fund and Youth Employment Initiative.   The public benefits will be increased knowledge about what works to help disadvantaged people, particularly young people not in employment, education or training to progress into work, and to develop skills policy at national and local level, including what provision DWP should fund. <divider>National Pupil Database (NPD) Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) Individualised Learner Record (ILR)<divider>2 - contains meaningful identifiers<divider>B - contains highly sensitive data about interactions with Children’s services C - contains sensitive data not captured as a Special Category within GDPR as they are specific to education but, which Dept. believe are equally sensitive, D - contains GDPR Special Category data E - contains lowest sensitivity data<divider>One-off<divider>Secure file transfer directly to the organisation<divider>30/10/2022<divider>Licence has not expired 
DS00268<divider>Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and Department for Education (Dept.)<divider>Dept. and MoJ wish to engage in a data share comprising of the educational characteristics and attainment of young people, from Dept., linked to data on their interactions with the criminal justice system, from MoJ.  The share is for research and statistical purposes only with the public benefit being improved understanding of potential links between educational outcomes/characteristics and involvement or risk of involvement with the criminal justice system. This is vital in aiding Government functions such as ensuring that education builds character, resilience and well-being; understanding the trends and drivers of crime; identifying the right cohorts of individuals to support through early intervention projects and the effectiveness of such interventions; and creating a prison and probation service that reforms offenders.  The value of sharing this data has previously been demonstrated by a one-off data share conducted in 2015 which underpinned a wide range of analysis, including: experimental statistics on the educational background of young offenders and young knife possession offenders; analysis in support of the Lammy and Taylor reviews; and preliminary research to inform Dept.’s policy agenda on behaviour, exclusion and special educational needs reforms.  Dept. and MOJ will put in place an ethics committee-based process to bring additional perspectives and oversight to thinking about how insights from this data share should be developed and exploited <divider>National Pupil Database (NPD)<divider>3 - contains meaningless identifiers<divider>B - contains highly sensitive data about interactions with Children’s services C - contains sensitive data not captured as a Special Category within GDPR as they are specific to education but, which Dept. believe are equally sensitive, D - contains GDPR Special Category data E - contains lowest sensitivity data<divider>Annually<divider>Secure file transfer directly to the organisation<divider>30/09/2022 <divider>Memorandum of Understanding reviewed annually.

DS00275<divider>University College London (UCL)<divider>UCL wishes to use National Pupil Database data (Key Stage 4 Pupil for 2018/2019 with Spring School Census Key Stage 2 prior attainment) in an Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) funded, independent evaluation.    With this data they will evaluate the impact on attainment of the SMART Spaces Revision programme, aiming to improve revision in chemistry and raise GCSE science grades. The programme involves training teachers of Year 11 pupils to deliver a set of revision classes, whose design is based on evidence from cognitive science about spaced learning. The impact of this programme will be evaluated using a randomised controlled trial by comparison with a “business as usual” control group, i.e. schools conducting normal revision.   The public benefit of this work will be to understand whether SMART Spaces can help improve revision in science and, as with all EEF funded evaluations, to build evidence for “what works” in raising the attainment of disadvantaged pupils. <divider>National Pupil Database (NPD)<divider>3 - contains meaningless identifiers<divider>C - contains sensitive data not captured as a Special Category within GDPR as they are specific to education but, which Dept. believe are equally sensitive, D - contains GDPR Special Category data E - contains lowest sensitivity data<divider>One-off<divider>ONS Secure Research Service<divider>31/08/2023<divider>Licence has not expired 
DS00277<divider>Welsh Government<divider>The Welsh Government wishes to use National Pupil Database data (absence data and Key Stage 4 (KS4) matched to relevant Spring School Census for 2015/16 to 2017/18, to identify those pupils who are resident in Wales but educated in England so that they may be included (along with pupils who are educated in Wales) in the calculation of indicators for the education domain of WIMD 2019.   The Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation (WIMD) is the Welsh Government’s official measure of relative deprivation for small areas in Wales. WIMD identifies concentrations of deprivation for a variety of aspects (or ‘domains’) of deprivation, for all residents of Wales.   The public benefit of this work will be to allow the KS4 and Repeat Absenteeism indicators, that make up the Education domain of the Welsh index of Multiple deprivation, to capture all children who reside in Wales (including those who attend school in England). This will make for a more accurate representation of the relative deprivation that exists across small areas of Wales (making data comparable across all areas – including those close to the Welsh/English border). This is important because WIMD data is widely used across the public sector, for example, to assist in targeting funding to those areas that need it most. It will also allow for a more accurate picture in local area assessments.    <divider>National Pupil Database (NPD)<divider>3 - contains meaningless identifiers<divider>E - contains lowest sensitivity data<divider>One-off<divider>Secure file transfer directly to the organisation<divider>30/09/2022<divider>Confirmation received data has been destroyed 
DS00279<divider>University of Warwick <divider>The Institute for Employment Research (University of Warwick) wishes to use linked School Workforce Census data for 2010 to the current date.  With this data they will explore earnings and career progression differentials over time for teachers with protected characteristics (i.e. gender, ethnic group, and by age) and seek to identify the factors explaining them.  The public benefit of this work will be to help identify sections of the teacher workforce in England which experience lower rates of pay, earnings growth or career progression (taking into account other structural factors) and highlight the factors which could be addressed to improve their situation.  The particular interest of the project lies in identifying the causes of earnings and career progression differentials between different types of teacher. As well as descriptive analysis, multivariate statistics will be used to identify the separate influence of a range of individual and contextual factors. <divider>School Workforce Census (SWC)<divider>3 - contains meaningless identifiers<divider>C - contains sensitive data not captured as a Special Category within GDPR as they are specific to education but, which Dept. believe are equally sensitive, D - contains GDPR Special Category data E - contains lowest sensitivity data<divider>Annually<divider>ONS Secure Research Service<divider>30/09/2022<divider>Secure environment deactivated 
DS00280<divider>University of Bristol and University of Sussex<divider>The University of Bristol and University of Sussex wish to use the National Pupil Database pupil level School Census data from 2014/15 to 2017/18, linked to parents’ school preferences for these four cohorts.    With this data they will explore how sensitive parents’ primary school choices are to school quality information provided by Ofsted. They will compare the school choices households make when new Ofsted information is revealed, providing new evidence on how school choices are made, conditional on where the household lives.   The public benefit of this work will be to show whether households value academic quality (as measured by Ofsted grade) and therefore whether school choice has the potential to improve education standards in England, benefitting pupils. By exploring variation in responsiveness to information about school quality across different types of households the research will inform whether school choice has the potential to benefit all or some pupils in England. <divider>National Pupil Database (NPD)<divider>3 - contains meaningless identifiers<divider>C - contains sensitive data not captured as a Special Category within GDPR as they are specific to education but, which Dept. believe are equally sensitive, D - contains GDPR Special Category data E - contains lowest sensitivity data<divider>One-off<divider>ONS Secure Research Service<divider>30/09/2024<divider>Original licence extended

With this data, FFT will undertake an evaluation of the Access Project, which works with bright students from disadvantaged backgrounds, providing in-school support and personalised tuition, to help them gain access to top third universities. This will be achieved through a non-experimental impact evaluation using NPD data. The GCSE and A-level outcomes of participating pupils from the 2018 cohort will be compared to those of similar pupils in similar schools.   The public benefit will be an evaluation of a project which seeks to improve outcomes for disadvantaged young people. The results will therefore be of significant interest to policymakers, schools and anyone with an interest in improving outcomes for this group. <divider>National Pupil Database (NPD) Individualised Learner Record (ILR)<divider>3 - contains meaningless identifiers<divider>C - contains sensitive data not captured as a Special Category within GDPR as they are specific to education but, which Dept. believe are equally sensitive, D - contains GDPR Special Category data E - contains lowest sensitivity data<divider>One-off<divider>ONS Secure Research Service<divider>31/10/2020<divider>Licence extension approved - awaiting paperwork 
DS00287<divider>Durham University<divider>Durham University has requested National Pupil Database pupil and school level data from 2015-16 to 2017-18.   The requested dataset will link pupil and school level data from the School Census, absence and exclusion records, Key Stage 2 and Key Stage 4 attainment data and information from the School Level Database.   With this data they will assess whether value-added models provide a valid and predictable method of evaluating school effectiveness. Specifically they will investigate whether the year-to-year variation in Progress 8 scores can be explained by detailed information about the changes that have occurred within schools.   This research will benefit the public by helping to ensure that school policy changes and parental decisions about school choice are supported by valid and reliable data. The results may also be of interest to school-leaders, OFSTED and the Department for Education, as value-added assessments play a key role in the procedures for evaluating and funding schools.   <divider>National Pupil Database (NPD)<divider>3 - contains meaningless identifiers<divider>C - contains sensitive data not captured as a Special Category within GDPR as they are specific to education but, which Dept. believe are equally sensitive, D - contains GDPR Special Category data E - contains lowest sensitivity data<divider>One-off<divider>ONS Secure Research Service<divider>30/11/2022<divider>Licence has not expired 
DS00295<divider>Sheffield Hallam University<divider>Sheffield Institute of Education at Sheffield Hallam University wishes to use National Pupil Database 2017/18 Key Stage 2 attainment data and pupil Free School Meals indicators to evaluate the impact of the education endowment funded Realistic Maths Education intervention (RME).   The RME project focuses on Y7 and Y8 pupils and offers specialist training for Key Stage 3 teachers which aims to develop pupils’ sense-making strategies and problem-solving abilities, raise pupil attainment and support teachers to promote a more interactive classroom culture. Materials and guidance for use in both mixed and set groups will be provided as part of this programme. This independent evaluation of RME in 119 English secondary schools will be used to establish whether RME leads to pupil gains in mathematics attainment.   There is the potential for public benefit through improvements to pupil learning, pupil engagement and teacher confidence.  <divider>National Pupil Database (NPD)<divider>3 - contains meaningless identifiers<divider>C - contains sensitive data not captured as a Special Category within GDPR as they are specific to education but, which Dept. believe are equally sensitive, E - contains lowest sensitivity data<divider>One-off<divider>ONS Secure Research Service<divider>31/10/2022<divider>Original licence extended

With this data they will evaluate the impact of the Social Mobility Foundation’s flagship programme, the Aspiring Professionals Programme, on long-run education outcomes for participants. These outcomes are participation in Higher Education, participation in a “high status” Higher Education Institute, participation in a course that facilitates access to professional occupations.   The public benefit of this work will be to understand whether programmes targeted at high-achieving students from disadvantaged backgrounds can improve education outcomes and therefore access to professional occupations to increase social mobility. <divider>National Pupil Database (NPD) Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA)<divider>3 - contains meaningless identifiers<divider>C - contains sensitive data not captured as a Special Category within GDPR as they are specific to education but, which Dept. believe are equally sensitive, D - contains GDPR Special Category data E - contains lowest sensitivity data<divider>One-off<divider>ONS Secure Research Service<divider>31/07/2022<divider>Licence extension approved - awaiting paperwork 
DS00298<divider>Children's Commissioner's Office (CCO)<divider>CCO has a statutory function to protect and promote the rights and interests of children in England, especially the most vulnerable. It also has a legal power (Children Act 2004, Section 2F) to access data on children in order to deliver this statutory function. CCO uses pseudonymised National Pupil Database (NPD) records (no names or addresses) for a range of quantitative data analysis projects on the outcomes and wellbeing of children. All analysis is statistical in nature and no disclosive or identifiable results are published. Projects for which NPD data has been used include the Stability Index; regional differences in educational progression; youth violence and exploitation by gangs; outcomes of children in need, children looked after and children with SEND; alternative provision and exclusions; children looked after in unregulated accommodation; home educated children; vulnerability in infancy and adolescence; and longitudinal analysis of early childhood attainment.

DS00302<divider>London School of Economics (LSE)<divider>LSE wishes to analyse data from the National Pupil Data base; Early Years Census and Schools Census (pupil and school levels), 2007-08 to 2018-19.  With this data LSE will investigate continuity and change in the take-up of funded early education by children’s background (including income, ethnicity, language, and area disadvantage), and the type of setting that children from different backgrounds attend. The study will look at the sector children attend, exposure to qualified teaching staff, and transitions from pre-school to school.  Prior research found that high quality provision and stable transitions matter, particularly for children who face more home disadvantages, and that mixed settings can be beneficial to children’s social and academic outcomes.  Research also shows that policy design can affect patterns of attendance. The study will examine the impact of recent policy changes (for example, the additional 15 funded hours for children in working families), so as to improve the understanding of the relationship between policy design and outcomes.   The public benefit of the work will be a better understanding of policy impact, which will be able to inform future reforms and further improve provision for children who have most to gain from high quality early years provision.  <divider>National Pupil Database (NPD)<divider>3 - contains meaningless identifiers<divider>C - contains sensitive data not captured as a Special Category within GDPR as they are specific to education but, which Dept. believe are equally sensitive, D - contains GDPR Special Category data E - contains lowest sensitivity data<divider>One-off<divider>ONS Secure Research Service<divider>31/12/2022<divider>Licence has not expired
DS00211<divider>Office For Students (OfS)<divider>Department for Education (Dept.) Secretary of State has asked OfS to use the Longitudinal Education Outcomes (LEO) data to improve the quality and value of higher education provision, and provide information that is more helpful to students. In addition, improved employment prospects is an important reason for entering higher education for many students, and LEO data will provide evidence on how this varies between different higher education courses.  Specifically, OfS will use LEO data to: • Make earnings and employment outcomes information available to prospective students. • Develop measures of how well students from different universities and colleges are prepared for employment, for use in the Teaching Excellence and Student Outcomes Framework (TEF) - a national exercise to assess excellence in teaching and ensuring excellent outcomes for students. • Develop measures of how well students are prepared for employment, to support monitoring of higher education providers.  <divider>Longitudinal Educational Outcomes (LEO)<divider>2 - contains meaningful identifiers<divider>C - contains sensitive data not captured as a Special Category within GDPR as they are specific to education but, which Dept. believe are equally sensitive, E - contains lowest sensitivity data<divider>Annually<divider>Secure file transfer directly to the organisation<divider>21/04/2023<divider>Service Level Agreement reviewed annually.
